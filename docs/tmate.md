# Setting Up `tmate`

Before you continue, read about [what is a terminal](shell.md).

Make sure you have setup `apt` if you use WSL and `brew` if you use macOS.

## What is `tmate`?

`tmate` is a tool that allows you to share your [terminal](shell.md) with others.  This allows another person to have enter text into _your_ terminal and to see the output returned by _your_ terminal.

We will use `tmate` to allow tutors to view and type into your terminal.  

Obviously giving someone else full control of your computer is dangerous -- so you need to be sure that you are sharing your terminal with someone you trust (e.g., your professor and your tutor).  Do NOT share your `tmate` link publicly.

## Installing `tmate` on WSL or Ubuntu

Run the following in your terminal:
```
sudo apt-get install tmate
```

## Installing `tmate` on macOS

Run the following in your terminal:
```
brew install tmate
```
