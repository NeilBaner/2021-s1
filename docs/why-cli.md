# Command Line Interface

## What is Command Line Interfaces?

The command line interfaces, or just CLI for short, is an important 
interface that we, as computing professionals, interact with 
the computer for most of our day-to-day tasks.

In constrast to graphical user interface where users use a mouse to
click/drag on menus and windows to interact with a computer, the
command line interface uses keyboard and text.  The users would type
a command to instruct the computer to do something, and the computer
would response by displaying the reply to the user.

CLI evolves from teletypes machines where users would interact with
the computer through a typewriter-like machine (see Figure 2.2. of
this article for an example).  Users would type a command on the 
keyboard, and the typewriter would print out, line-by-line, the output
on a piece of paper.  This is the era before monitor and mouse. 
Again, driven by the constraints and the necessity, CLI interface
is designed to be simple and economy.  _The commands are short an
fast to type; the response are succint._

## Why CLI over GUI?

Since CLI is designed to be economical, CLI is much more efficient
and productive to use, in particular when we are interacting with
a remote computer over the network -- sending text back and forth
is much more efficient than sending graphical elements over the
network.  Each character takes up to two byte, but each pixel alone
takes up 3 bytes of data.

Another reason why using CLI is faster and more productive is that
user can keep their hands on the keyboard at all time and _not
needing to switch frequently between keyboard and mouse._  While
research has showned that GUI and mouse are great for casual users,
for software developers that needs to type on the keyboard most of
the time, having to switch between keyboard and mouse is a
productivity-killer.
