This year, we will conduct the \"UNIX@Home\" version, entirely online via Zoom. Objectives The aims for the workshop are To introduce students to using UNIX-based computing environment for daily computing tasks To prepare students to be efficient in using UNIX for their computing career After taking the workshop, students are expected to: Understand common terminology: UNIX, Linux, Ubuntu, SunOS, ssh, host, command line, shell, operating systems, etc. Appreciate the advantages of the UNIX environment Understand the UNIX file organization Able to perform common file management tasks (create/copy/move/remove/change permission, etc) through UNIX shell (For Windows 10 users) Setup local UNIX environment Setup apt (Win10) or Homebrew (macOS) and able to use it to install library or applications Time and Venue There will be two versions of the workshop, one for macOS users, the other for Windows 10 users. The date and time are as follows: 3-4 August , 2020 (Mon - Tue), 9:00 to 11:30 am each day. for macOS users only 6-7 August , 2020 (Thu - Fri), 9:00 to 11:30 am each day. for Windows 10 users only The workshop will be conducted online via Zoom. Registration First year students taking CS1010, CS2030, CS2030S, and CS2040 in Semester 1 of AY2020/21 will be given priority to register for and to attend the workshop. The workshop is sponsored by the NUS School of Computing and is free to attend. Space, however, is limited -- please register only if you are committed to attend.
